                        face to make the famous smiley-face t-shirt. The salesman is grateful.

                        room at The Watergate, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. At night, Gump
                        called the

                        awake. The next scene shows Nixon resigning from the presidency after the Watergate Scandale.
