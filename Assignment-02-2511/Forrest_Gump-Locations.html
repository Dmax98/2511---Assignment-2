                            <p>&emsp;At this location, Forrest Gump finds his darling, Jenny. Jenny was his childhood
                                friend and
                                sweetheart, but they separated for a little bit as she became a hippie and attended an all-girls
                                university. Forest, during this scene, attended an anti-Vietnam war protest but is caught off

                       <p>&emsp;It is at the lighthouse here in Marshall Point where Forrest Gump decided to stop for a
                        break during his cross country run.</p>

                <figcaption> Location: Blueridge Parkway, North Carolina</figcaption> <p>&emsp;During the movie, Forrest starts to run across the country. Most of the mountain scenes
                    were
                    filmed in Blueridge Parkway in North Carolina. The most famous part of the run is on
                    Grandfather mountain where runs a curve and says, "And after that, I got more company, and then
                    even more people joined in" with Fleetwood Mac's You can go your own way in the background.

             <p>&emsp;This movie location is the most important out of all of them. During the
            movie Forest
            Gump, Tom
            Hanks, sat down at a park bench with a box of chocolates. Gump sat next to a woman, and
            he began to tell her his life story. Most of the others scenes are throwbacks to his past. </p> </div>

                <figcaption> Location: Twin Arrows Trading Post, Coconino County, Arizona</figcaption>
                <p>&emsp;During Gump's run across the country, he runs past the twin arrows trading post in
                Arizona.
                During this scene, Gump gets sprayed dirt on him by a trucker while running on the side of the
                road. After getting sprayed on, a t-shirt salesman runs past him to get help with a design. The
                man
                felt bad for him and gave Gump a yellow shirt to clean the mud. "Accidentally" however, Gump
                so happened to wipe his
                face to make the famous smiley-face t-shirt. The salesman is grateful.</p>

                <p>&emsp;During one of the many times that Forrest met the president, he was invited
                    with the ping pong team. During the award ceremony, Richard Nixon asked him where he was
                    staying. Nixon thought that he should be staying in a better place and got him a
                    room at The Watergate, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. At night, Gump
                    called the
                    front desk to report that they may want to send some people over to help fix a room across
                    the window from Gump. Many people had a flashlight, and it was keeping pour Forest
                    awake. The next scene shows Nixon resigning from the presidency after the Watergate Scandal.</p></div>

                        <p>&emsp;Monument Valley is where Forrest Gump decided to end his three-year run. The reason why he
                            decided to stop the run because he was both tired but also because he remembered his mom saying
                            that you got to put your past behind you before you can move on to which he thought that that is
                            the reason why he was running.</p>

                        &emsp;During the movie, Gump's childhood was set in the town of Greenbow, Alabama. Although
                                    Greenbow
                                    is a fictional town, and the actual filming location was in Yemassee, South Carolina.
                                    Some famous scenes are Jennies Farmhouse and Hank's Boarding home.
                                    The image to the left is the driveways to the boarding home. Famous parts include forest running
                                    down the road in crutches and going down the road to Greenbow, Alabama.

                        <p>&emsp;Hunters Island is where most of the Vietnam scenes were filmed. During these scenes, we
                            get
                            to
                            see
                            Bubba and Lieutenant Dan. Although Bubba died in the war, Forest kept the dream alive and
                            started the shrimping business once he left the army.</p>
