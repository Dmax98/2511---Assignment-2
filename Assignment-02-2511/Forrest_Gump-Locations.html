                        felt bad for him and gave Gump a yellow shirt to clean the mud. "Accidentally" however, Gump

                        face to make the famous smiley-face t-shirt. The salesman is grateful.

                        room at The Watergate, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. At night, Gump
                        called the
                        front desk to report that they may want to send some people over to help fix a room across

                        awake. The next scene shows Nixon resigning from the presidency after the Watergate Scandale.
